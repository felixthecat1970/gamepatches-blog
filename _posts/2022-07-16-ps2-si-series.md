!!! 60fps from this series is heavy for PS2 EE (CPU) in consoles framerate will be variable between 30fps  - 60fps !!!
!!! in PCSX2-QT emulator use my personal profiles for have better performance but "maybe" unknow crash or bugs can happen!!!

## FAQ:
### This codes is for ? 
Use in PC emulator PCSX2-QT, PS3 CONSOLES (hdmi-component 480p-720p-1080p setups only), PS2 CONSOLES (with component progressive tv setups) incompactible with interleaced signals setups like rf, rca white/red/yellow cables.

### This can be used with original game disks ?
yes, but only in ps2 consoles and ps3 fat ps2 backward compactibility models like the 60gb-20gb USA/JAPAN and a method load cheats files format .pnach, i hear PS2 OPL homebrew can load cheats but i have not tested yet more info [PS2 OPL HOMEBREW](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) or gameshark alike devices (you need to convert codes which is hard); my recomended step is have your console homebrew enabled, dump your game in pc and patch it; for more tech oriented/seasoned people "how to dump correctly" [link](http://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=Dumping_Guides) or try imgburn app in windows, brazero or similar app (linux); you can verify game dump in redump database [HERE](http://redump.org/discs/system/ps2/).
